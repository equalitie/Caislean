# What is this?

This file lists all the Ansible variables that are in use in Caisleán. Most
often, each host has its own host variables file in the `host_vars` directory,
with its own values for a subset of these variables. If you have no idea what
this means, take a look at the Ansible documentation on
[variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html).

Every variable is generally required by only a few roles. It may also be
optional. The "Required in" and "Optional in" statements below list the roles
for which each variable is required.

You will also find a list of all required variables in every role's
documentation file (see the `doc/role-doc/` directory).
